# Library Usage

## Description
Index of the documentation for developers consuming Agnos-Cli as a Go library: wiring an adapter into the sandbox, calling the tracker from code, and looking up the public API. Driving the same behavior from a terminal is indexed by [CliUsage.md](/docs/Index/CliUsage.md); changing the library is indexed by [Development.md](/docs/Index/Development.md).

The library is always built the same way: an adapter produces a `deps.Deps`, `lib.New` injects it into the closed sandbox, and the returned `api.Lib` carries every behavior.

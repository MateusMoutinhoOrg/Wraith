# LibObjects Specification

## Description
Defines the required shape of an object created by the library — a package under `sandbox/<object>/` holding the **factories** that fill a struct declared in `sandbox/contracts/api/api.go`, plus the `New` constructor that builds it. The object is the api struct itself: it carries its own propagated `Deps`, and there is no separate internal mirror type.

### Rules
- Each object lives in its own package under `sandbox/`, named `<object>` after the object it fills. No `internal_` prefix — the `internal/` parent already marks the package private.
- `sandbox/` holds **only factories and constructors**. The object's type is declared in `sandbox/contracts/api`; an internal package may import contracts, never the reverse.
- The object's api struct declares a `Deps deps.Deps` field plus its properties — see the [Outputs](/docs/References/Specs/Outputs/Specs.md) specification.
- One factory per function field, named `<Field>Factory` and taking a single `*api.<Object>` parameter, whose body returns a closure for that field. The closure reads the object's properties and `o.Deps` through the pointer, so both are current at call time.
- The package must expose a `New(d deps.Deps, …) api.<Object>` constructor that fills the `Deps` and data fields, calls **every** field factory and assigns its return value into the matching field, and returns the struct by value. `New` is the factory aggregate — there is no separate `Factory` function. A field no factory's return value is assigned into stays nil and panics on first call.
- The object is created only through a factory on `Lib` (e.g. `NewExampleObjectFactory`) whose returned closure calls `<object>.New(l.Deps, …)`, propagating the lib's deps — callers never build it directly.
- Factories reach dependencies only through the object's `Deps` field, calling them as function fields: `o.Deps.<Field>(...)`. `sandbox/` is a closed sandbox: an object package must never import `adapters/`, `examples/libraryExamples/`, a third-party module, or an OS-bound standard-library package (`os`, `net`, `syscall`, …). See [SandboxIsolation.md](/docs/References/SandboxIsolation.md).
- Exported api structs, constructors, and factories must have doc comments, and the public fields must be listed in [PublicApi.md](/docs/References/PublicApi.md).

## Structure
1. **Struct declaration** (in `sandbox/contracts/api/api.go`): a `Deps deps.Deps` field, the object's data fields, and the function fields it exposes — see [Outputs](/docs/References/Specs/Outputs/Specs.md).
2. **Field factories** (in `sandbox/<object>/<object>.go`): `func <Field>Factory(o *api.<Object>) <FieldType>`, each returning one closure.
3. **`New` constructor**: `func New(d deps.Deps, …) api.<Object>` filling the `Deps` and data fields, calling every field factory exactly once and assigning its return value into the matching field, and returning the struct.
4. **Constructor factory** (in `sandbox/lib/`): `func New<Object>Factory(l *api.Lib) func(...) api.<Object>` whose returned closure calls `<object>.New(l.Deps, …)`.

Amounts are decimal, with at most two places: 84.50, 84.5 and 84 are all
accepted. They are always positive — the command chooses the direction.

Examples:
  agnos-cli category add groceries
  agnos-cli spend groceries "weekly shopping" 84.50
  agnos-cli received salary "august paycheck" 2500.00
  agnos-cli balance groceries

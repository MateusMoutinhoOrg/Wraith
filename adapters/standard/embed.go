package standard

// The standard adapter's embedded-asset implementation: the factory filling
// deps.Deps.EmbedDeps out of the assets compiled into the binary. It lives in
// its own file because it is the one part of this adapter that reaches for a
// package of the project outside the sandbox — assets — and because the
// conversion helpers below belong to it and to nothing else.
//
// Everything here is outside the sandbox, which is what makes the `embed`
// directive and the io/fs walk legal: the sandbox only ever sees the three
// function fields of embeddeps.Lib.
